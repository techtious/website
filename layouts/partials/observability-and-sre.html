    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>End-to-End Visibility</strong> – Monitor infrastructure, applications, and user experience through metrics, logs, and traces.</li>
      <li><strong>Higher Reliability</strong> – Reduce outages, improve uptime, and ensure predictable performance through SLO-driven engineering.</li>
      <li><strong>Faster Incident Response</strong> – Detect, resolve, and learn from failures quickly using automation, alerting, and runbooks.</li>
      <li><strong>Balanced Innovation</strong> – Error budgets and observability insights help teams deliver features faster without risking stability.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h3>How We Deliver</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Assessment & Maturity Analysis</strong> – Evaluate your monitoring systems, reliability metrics, and on-call processes.</li>
      <li><strong>Observability Implementation</strong> – Set up metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, ELK, or OpenTelemetry.</li>
      <li><strong>SRE Foundations</strong> – Define SLIs/SLOs, build error budgets, establish on-call workflows, automation, and incident management practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous Reliability & Improvement</strong> – Post-incident reviews, chaos testing, performance tuning, and cost-optimized observability.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="service-description">
  Modern digital systems demand both visibility and resilience. Our Observability & Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) service helps you achieve exactly that — a platform where every system component is measurable, failures are predictable, and recovery is automated.
  <br /><br />
  We design and implement observability frameworks powered by metrics, logs, traces, and real-time dashboards, giving your teams complete insight into system behavior. Combined with SRE principles like SLOs, error budgets, automation, and blameless incident management, we ensure your applications stay reliable while your development teams continue to innovate confidently.
  <br /><br />
  Whether you are building from scratch or enhancing existing systems, we help you establish scalable monitoring, alerting, on-call practices, and operational excellence that grows with your business.
